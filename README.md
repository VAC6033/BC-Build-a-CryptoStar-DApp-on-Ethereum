# BC-Build-a-CryptoStar-DApp-on-Ethereum

I am unable to create a private network with this spec on MetaMask:
Private Network 1	http://127.0.0.1:9545/	1337

MetaMask just hangs and then says that something went wrong and to try again.

Also I am waiting for a single Ether to be received in my Rinkeby account despite posting my receiving address in a public Facebook post some days ago. Still waiting!
